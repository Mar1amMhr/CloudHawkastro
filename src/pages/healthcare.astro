						<p>Healthcare software development in terms of digital transformation is a holistic process that doesnâ€™t only mean acquiring or developing new digital solutions but also may require multiple improvements to business operation. With Cloud Hawk, you can get an all-around digital healthcare transformation experience and a wide range of medical software development services. We can:</p>
<ul>
<li>assess your current business processes and healthcare workflow</li>
<li>conduct market research and compose a digital transformation roadmap with precise iterations of your business growth and individual software development process</li>
<li>set up an optimized development and testing framework for your technical team</li>
<li>enhance your in-house development team with our medical software developers</li>
<li>build custom healthcare software solutions from scratch or securely integrate existing solutions that suit your business model</li>
</ul>
<h2>Debunking common misconceptions about healthcare digital transformation</h2>
<p>Choosing a digital transformation path in the healthcare industry is a time-consuming but much safer option than adopting diverse third-party healthcare solutions without proper business process visibility and transparency. Third-party healthcare software solutions may not exchange data with each other or with your on-premises software systems and may even lack HIPAA compliance, causing security vulnerabilities and putting your clinical data at risk.</p>
<p>Your digital transformation may require less time and effort if you find a reliable healthcare software development vendor. An experienced software partner can help you avoid many pitfalls associated with software development as well as develop your own unique transformation approach that wonâ€™t disrupt your healthcare service delivery or cause any treatment delays for your patients. Additionally, healthcare software development companies such as Cloud Hawk have deep expertise in the healthcare domain and can help you incorporate industry best practices and ensure a quicker path to success. However, beginning with digital transformation doesnâ€™t mean developing several healthcare software systems at once. You can start small and gradually build your way up to complete digitalization.</p>
<p>Below, we discuss how you can get started on your winning digital transformation journey.</p>
<h2>Improvements to healthcare business operations based on a real-world example</h2>
<p>When deciding to digitally transform your healthcare business, you should first clearly define and prioritize desired outcomes from this transformation, such as scaling your business, acquiring more customers, optimizing costs, enhancing staff productivity and performance, or eliminating paperwork. Your software development goals will help you choose the right focus areas to begin your gradual digital transformation with the assistance of a trusted healthcare software development company.</p>
<p>For instance, to actively scale your business, youâ€™ll need to focus on constantly optimizing your companyâ€™s organizational and technical structure. Thus, you will need to regularly audit your business processes. Auditing the organizational processes of our clientâ€™s medical PACS teleradiology platform helped us discover hidden operational issues hindering the companyâ€™s growth and software development workflow, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>a cumbersome customer support system</li>
<li>lack of motivation in the in-house software development team</li>
<li>all developers working as a single team with the same stakeholders</li>
</ul>
<h3>How we helped a medical PACS company to regain seamless business workflow</h3>
<p>To fix these operational issues, we implemented parallel development workflows with separate <em>main</em> and <em>supportive</em> healthcare software development teams. The main team was responsible for core platform functionality and critical issues, and the supportive team was responsible for the healthcare softwareâ€™s additional features, less important issues, and customer support. Each workflow had its own stakeholders to offer changes and validate processes. After setting up a new operational environment for our client, we conducted a few workshops for their team so they could quickly grasp the new way of working.</p>
<p>While assessing software development processes, we realized our client had issues with testing procedures and continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). As a solution, we established an automated testing framework for the client to run automatic parallel tests whenever necessary and implemented CI/CD to fit newly formed parallel software development workflows. Such optimization, in both the technical and organizational realms, allowed our client to speed up product delivery, process user feedback faster, and increase their customer satisfaction rate and development teamsâ€™ performance. The new healthcare software development workflow also helped our client continue effectively growing their product and increasing their brand reach.</p>
<p>It is essential to optimize your business processes first before proceeding with digitally growing your healthcare business. Letâ€™s dive deeper into actual healthcare software product development.</p>
<h2>Tailored software development in healthcare: Is it the right option for every healthcare business?</h2>
<p>As part of the digital transformation process, you can consider implementing many healthcare software systems in your practice. We recommend ensuring interoperability between all of your software solutions to establish end-to-end healthcare service for your patients and an effective work experience for your employees. With this in mind, itâ€™s best to build custom healthcare software solutions or look for ready-made ones that easily exchange data with one another and fit your needs. Most importantly, any software solution you implement in your daily healthcare practice should simplify and optimize the delivery of your healthcare services rather than complicate it.</p>
<h3>How you can benefit from healthcare software development catered to your needs</h3>
<p>Here are a few benefits you can get from incorporating a custom end-to-end digital healthcare network:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduce instances of human error</strong>. Even the slightest error in the healthcare industry can have life-threatening consequences. Automated digital healthcare systems such as medication dosage systems can increase patient safety.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure easy access to healthcare information for patients and healthcare practitioners.</strong> When medical workers have quick and effortless access to patientsâ€™ vital information, they can develop individual treatment plans faster and serve more patients in need.</li>
<li><strong>Provide personalized treatment plans to patients.</strong> For instance, by gathering a patientâ€™s vitals via medical IoT devices and using healthcare software with machine learning algorithms to analyze the patientâ€™s medical history and lifestyle (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/expertise/machine-learning-development/machine-learning-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep learnung solutions</a>)</span>, clinicians can form an overall picture of the patientâ€™s health and provide more personalized and accurate treatment.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce manual work and unburden your medical staff.</strong> With the help of healthcare technology, medical staff can focus on patient care and do less tedious administrative work such as filling out paper forms.</li>
<li><strong>Establish solid grounds for further healthcare business scaling.</strong> Healthcare software development companies can deliver highly scalable software systems that allow them to stay flexible and build ambitious business expansion plans.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your business isnâ€™t ready yet for investing in custom healthcare software development, you can consider implementing a ready-made healthcare solution such as EHR systems Cerner or Epic. However, we recommend you entrust this integration to a reliable healthcare software development partner to make the integration process as smooth as possible. For instance, our team can not only find suitable third-party solutions for you but can also ensure proper interoperability among all of these solutions using an enterprise service bus (ESB) or a message queue system like Kafka.</p>
<h3>Critical steps to take for a successful healthcare software development process</h3>
<p>If you do opt for custom health software development, these are the steps we can take to build your successful custom software.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, business analysts will prepare a detailed plan of all the healthcare processes and services that should be digitalized in your company.</li>
<li>Once you choose the healthcare software solutions to build first, our UI/UX designers can start preparing wireframes and discuss with you how you want your digital healthcare solution to look and feel.</li>
<li>Then you can work with our software development team on a feature roadmap to prioritize the functionality set for the first release. Itâ€™s important to note that your first custom solution can be a minimum viable product, or an MVP. An MVP is a better option than a full-fledged healthcare software system, as you can get a tangible product to test with your users and critical stakeholders without pouring lots of money and effort into development.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final thoughts on healthcare digital transformation and whether itâ€™s worth it</h3>
<p>Healthcare digital transformation is a substantial and lengthy process, but itâ€™s worth it if you want your healthcare company to scale and want to improve business processes. With a detailed and well-established digital transformation roadmap, healthcare software development best practices, an optimized development environment, and efficient operational processes, we can make this transformation much more feasible. Our team can provide you with healthcare digital transformation consulting services and guide you through the whole journey of healthcare software development to ensure you consistently reach all of your business goals.</p>
